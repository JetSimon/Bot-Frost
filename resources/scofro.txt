I don't know if we'd identified any particular places and made them priorities.
We're going to go where the players are.
I don't care where they are, if they're in Jamaica or Kazakhstan, we're going.
If they're in Michigan, so be it.
We're going to come up and try to get the best players we can.
You know, I think everybody in the state and in our building were happy with the progress that we made and kind of the results at the end of the season.
And it was a long, hard road through that time.
There was a lot of things that had to get changed, fixed, adjusted.
We're still working on it.
It's a never-ending process.
It's never going to be perfect.
It's never going to be done.
It's never going to be complete.
But we were certainly farther down the road at the end of the season than we were at the beginning.
I think our team did a really good job of picking up from that point and moving forward.
Love the attitude in our locker room right now and the work ethic that they've been showing all off-season.
We cost ourselves arguably a bunch of games just because of those things, mentalities and attitudes and decisions, and hopefully we have a lot of that fixed.
Well, we coached a lot of really good kids and really good players in Orlando.
We've got a lot of really good kids and really good players in Lincoln.
Those two teams have nothing to do with one another, and I'm never going to make any comparisons.
I love where I am.
I'm the coach at Nebraska.
We're concerned about this team.
I love the progress this team has made.
But you guys get to make all the predictions and prognostications.
I get to coach the team, so I don't know about any results.
I don't think our kids feel pressure.
They're just excited to play.
We're better.
We're better than we were a year ago, and the rest of it we're going to have to earn.
I don't remember saying that directly to the coaches, but I think any time you take over a business, an organization, a sports team, year 2 get easier than year 1.
There's a lot of groundwork that had to be laid.
Nebraska is one of the teams that for a long time was one of the blue bloods of college football and winning as many game as anybody.
That wasn't built overnight.
It's not going to be built overnight again.
I have a strong sense that we're way ahead of where we were a year ago, and I think we'll keep improving from here.
I think we'll be a better team every time we get to play one of the teams that are on our schedule.
Yeah, I wouldn't trade our guy for anybody in the country at that position, at the quarterback position.
On top of being a great player, he's just a great individual, exactly what we're looking for to run our offense.
We're probably going to go as far as he can take us this year.
I played the position, not as well as he plays it, but I played the position.
And from personal experience and coaching experience, I think particularly at that position, your biggest jump comes from your first year of playing to your second year of playing, and I've seen that happen with some of the guys that I've coached, as well.
As good as he was last year, if we get a similar jump, we're going to be really strong at that spot.
Probably of all the areas we've improved, strength and conditioning across the board on our team has improved the most.
It's fun to go down and watch in the weight room and see what our guys are doing.
We were kind of starting from square one when Zach Duval and our strength staff, who are as good as there is out there, got ahold of our guys.
We couldn't even really do the workouts at that point that he wanted them to do because I don't think they were prepared for that.
He didn't think they were prepared for that.
So we were really starting at go a year and a half ago.
To look now and see what our guys are doing in the weight room and really just looking at them when you walk by them and seeing them in the locker room, in the hallways, they look completely different.
This is a big, physical league.
There's a lot of big, physical teams, a lot of really good teams, and regardless of your scheme on offense or defense, you can't get pushed around, you can't get outworked, and you can't get outsized.
We made a lot of strides to catch up, and I think that will show up on the field.
Yeah, it was a pretty easy choice, honestly, to bring Adrian, because number one, he deserves it.
He's as good a player as we have, and I think as good a player as a lot of people have around the country, so he deserves to be here.
Just letting you guys in on a little secret, usually we would bring seniors.
We're not going to have any seniors, or very many seniors on offense this year.
Coaches also kind of think we've got to bring a guy that is going to speak well to represent us and say and do the right things, and he's the poster child for that.
He deserves to be in the spotlight.
He can handle it, he's ready for it, and he's here.
Yeah, center, left guard, we're waiting to see which guys emerge.
There's going to be a few competitions on our team for some spots.
I think most of the spots on the team are pretty clear-cut who the top guys are going to be.
But that can shake out in fall camp, too.
We still have a few holes, but most teams do.
We still have depth issues at a few spots.
But show me a team that doesn't.
We're like anybody else.
We're going to need to stay healthy this year and have a few guys step up.
We feel really good about some spots, and losing those two interior guys certainly didn't help.
But we have some good talented young guys that I think have the potential to be even better.
We just need that to come to fruition quickly.
It was really important, considering how we approached practice this week, letting the guys rest this week and really light practice on Tuesday.
It's easy to not come in prepared to play, and I thought at least at the start of the game the guys were really dialed in and ready to go.
That set the stage for the rest of the things we wanted to accomplish in the game which is getting some other guys in and then finishing it off.
Those are great, turnovers are great.
That's one of the areas we've been lacking.
We've got to create turnovers to get the offense the ball back.
It's good to see those in this game, I hope they carry over into some of the other games we have the rest of the year.
We blocked everybody on that play.
Our special teams did get better, I think they have been improving.
Confused special teams plays probably cost us a couple games this year and it was good to see us finally get one on special teams.
You score on defense or special teams, you're going to win most games.
We haven't had one yet, so it was good to see us break the ice.
We needed that to happen.
We needed to go out and get the game secured early.
I've said it a bunch, 12 weeks in a row is a long time, 13 weeks of practice in a row of practice is a long time without any break.
It isn't just the physical, it's the grind of it.
It takes a toll on you emotionally, especially with what these guys have been through this season.
We needed a break, we didn't get one.
Physically it was important for us to put the game away so that the guys could play 30, 35, 40 snaps and be done.
I think that's going to help us down the stretch with the last four.
Absolutely.
I think they knew if they went out and took care of business that some of those other guys would get some reps.
Then, you've got (Matt) Jarzynka making sacks and the guys going crazy and some other guys out there making plays that haven't gotten a chance to yet.
That kind of feeling of team and camaraderie has really grown over the course of this year and it was exciting to see the old guys that excited for the kids that haven't played much.
I've seen Noah practice for a long time and I know how good of a player he is.
There were some things that I think he could have done better.
We made too many mistakes when those other guys were in there, but it was good seeing him get in the end zone.
I know growing up here, when I was little that was all I could think about was scoring as a Husker and it's been kind of a weird path for him to get there, but it was great to see him dive into the end zone at Memorial Stadium.
Simply, he hadn't played yet this year, Bunchy has gotten a shot this year.
I think both guys are capable, both guys are great guys.
Noah's been practicing really well and I know how good of a player he can be, and he already is.
We thought it was time to give him a shot and let him his run out there.
Yeah, JoJo is a guy that every time we've been ready to give him an extended role he's had a little health issue this year.
Kind of felt bad for him but he's good enough to play for us at safety, he's playing a little nickel.
We need more guys and more depth and guys that are capable of making plays, and I saw JoJo make a few out there today.
We're making fewer mistakes.
There's still one 15-yard penalty, I don't know what that is yet, we've gotta get that cleaned up.
Having officials at practice I think has helped, so the guys understand and don't practice bad habits.
But, more than anything, just the standards of the team have gone up and the expectations among the players for what's acceptable and what's not have gotten better and that's led to fewer penalties.
We've gotten a little, some of the coaches have gotten quite a bit.
The only people, in my experience, shouldn't look too far ahead are the play callers on both sides.
You don't want to get your wires crossed thinking about one team while calling the play for a different team.
That doesn't always happen, but you have to be careful.
Any game we go into, we're going to go with 100 percent of our focus to make sure we can do the best we can in the game, but I think quite a few coaches have gotten a look at them and we'll get a good game plan ready tomorrow.
We'll find out, I hope quite a bit more.
I think we're a more disciplined team, I think we're a more efficient team right now.
Hopefully the last two means we're going to be more of a confident team.
We've got to go on the road to a tough place to play a very good team that's going to be ticked off and had two weeks to practice since their last game that didn't go well for them.
We know what we're in for, we're going to get their best shot.
I don't want to compare two teams in our league, we're going to play them both.
I'm appreciative of them for coming.
I think it was great for both teams, it was the type of game we needed.
I'm sure the amount of money we're paying for them to come up is something they needed.
I think both teams got out of the game really healthy, which is what both coaches wanted, and I think it was a win-win for everybody.
Would've loved to see their band, but I'm a bigger fan of Nebraska's band, so those are good people that we just played and I think they had a good experience, and I'm glad it happened the way it did.
In the January recruiting cycle, we wanted to look around and take a look and see if we thought anybody fit us and if they did take our best swing at them.
This year was different than last year.
Last year, there was quite a bit of really good players still available after the first signing day.
This year, there weren't near as many and the guys that were got recruited by everybody.
I've been doing this long enough to know that sometimes when you want to just take another guy or two to fill a spot, those don't turn out as good as often as guys you've recruited and know well.
So, we did our best to get to know some guys and take some looks at some guys that we thought might still be able to help at certain positions but we weren't going to reach and take guys just to take them.
I think this is probably where we'll land going forward and I think most people will.
I think people are landing there because that's the trend right now.
Like I said last year, there was a good number of good players that didn't sign.
There were still some last year, but not the same numbers.
If this year is any indication, most people are going to sign their classes early and you better have the guys in the boat that you really want with a few spots in your back pocket if you're doing it right.
Just being honest, when you come in as a new coach you're two years behind because you're just trying to come in here.
We were just starting to look at 2019 guys last year that we could get to Nebraska in December.
We're a lot farther down the road now, looking at 2020s already in January, some 2021s.
We're probably still a half a cycle behind, but that's going to be easy to catch the rest of the way up in May, having already looked at some young kids in May recruiting.
We can be a little bit more specific with some of the targets we've already found and we'll probably be able to get even farther ahead with the 2021 class.
There's nothing about what we're trying to do that can get fixed at the drop of a hat.
Coming in, there was a couple of position groups that were desperately low with scholarship players and players in general.
There were some things we had to fix to get them the way we wanted them.
We're getting a heck of a lot closer, but going into this recruiting cycle I wanted to take the best players I could and try to help our team as much as we could knowing we weren't going to be able to fill all the holes and get all the pieces that we want in one year.
I say this about a lot of the guys, but first thing is that we really liked him as a person, really enjoyed his family.
Demariyon is a kid that can really run.
Our offense, as long as I've been in it, has been really successful and dangerous when we have a bunch of people that are weapons and can do a lot with the ball in their hands.
Demariyon's got legitimate speed, was a good player on both sides of the ball and returning kicks down in Oklahoma.
Receiver was one of the areas that we were way below the number of players that we need or would like to have when we walked into the door a year ago.
That was one of our priorities, to get some guys in and bring them along and start developing.
We felt like we could use one more and we were glad he was available.
I don't want to get into specifics, but we have a baseline number for how many outside backers, inside backers, D-Line and so forth that we'd like to have on scholarship.
It's never exact, you're always one over at one spot, one under at another spot, but we're getting a lot closer to where we need to be from a depth standpoint.
Losing Stanley (Morgan Jr.) is going to be tough to replace.
He was a great player around here for a long time, gosh I enjoyed being around him for a year.
Hopefully, some of these young guys that we brought in can help fill the gap.
There are some guys on campus that I'm expecting to make huge jumps this year.
A lot of times, the first year in a system, some kids don't quite flourish and they make a huge jump in year two.
There's a bunch of guys already on the roster from (Jaevon) McQuitty, to (Jaron Woodyard) Woody to Mike (Williams) to Andre Hunt, to even some walk-ons like (Wyatt) Liewer and (Bennett) Folkers.
There are a bunch of guys that I think can take a step forward and help us next year.
There's a bunch of candidates to get us with three-four good wide receivers on the field and I feel a lot better about that than I did a year ago.
We fought hard for a lot of our commits, a lot of guys put a lot of time in for these guys and I tip my cap to the coaching staff.
Coach Fisher, Coach Chinander, Coach Held, Coach Verduzco and Coach Dawson were all involved in recruiting him.
I think he felt at home here, I think he felt like this was a good opportunity.
He's a dynamic playmaker, he's aggressive.
You saw him hit on Wandale (Robinson) in the All-Star Game and you could kind of see what both kids are made of from that play and that game in general.
I love that we're adding more speed, I love the attitudes that we're adding, I like the toughness we're adding and Noa certainly is a part of that.
He signed in December, and we kept it under our hat as best we could to allow him to announce it at the Polynesian game the way he wanted to, but he's a big addition for us.
The first thing I'm anxious about is the transfer portal is going to be old news very soon, as many kids that are going to put their name in.
Obviously we've had some kids go in.
There's going to be different circumstances.
We had one kid go in that just wanted to look around, but his heart was here and we welcomed him back.
I think it's going to be more and more important for coaches to have great relationships with their kids and have a building that everybody wants to be in and keep everybody happy so you don't lose them.
But there's going to be kids from all over the country in that portal.
I think it's going to be important to have a spot or two in your back pocket in case the right kid becomes available.
For us, it's got to be the right kid.
It's got to be someone that's going to fit on our team and it's somebody that's talented enough to help us.
We'll certainly keep our eye on that and we have some flexibility to take one or two of those if the situation arises.
Well, you don't become a captain of a team unless you're a good teammate, and we want kids who are good teammates.
I think he was anxious to play with his brother for a year.
His brother kept hinting at it and we kept telling him we couldn't do anything until the season was over, and if he put his name in the transfer portal.
After he did, honestly it happened really fast and this is where he wanted to be.
So we were glad to add a piece on our defensive line and I think he's going to help us.
Devine ended up being such a big piece for us last year.
I think he surprised everybody, maybe even including himself, in how well he performed this year.
I think he's got a future in football.
That's tough to replace.
That being said, I think the group we have, led by Mo Washington and some other young guys, are going to make that position more talented than it has been.
But we're going to be really young, so we felt like we needed to add somebody that maybe had some experience.
Getting to know Dedrick, he's taken an unusual path to get where he is, but we really enjoyed being around him and getting to know him and seeing what he's fought through.
He's got some work to do to get here, but we feel confident it's going to get done.
He's more of an every-down back, somebody that's older and hopefully a little more durable, and a very talented player.
So we need to get him here and evaluate all that, but we're excited about him.
T-Fish has had great players everywhere he's been.
He does a great job managing his room, he does a great job recruiting to get talent in his room.
That's going to be a really talented group of kids.
There's some older guys with Dicaprio , with Deontai .
There's going to be a lot of young talent, too.
So some of those old guys are going to have to keep playing well.
They're going to have to compete a little more and they're going to have to show that they can be leaders.
Some of the young guys were anxious to get in here and let them run around and compete.
I think that's going to be a deeper unit than we've had.
To be honest with you, that group struggled a little bit to adapt to the way we wanted to do things early on in the year.
The message to me coming out of the weight room is that group's about the best one in the weight room right now.
Between the strength and conditioning group and Coach Fish and Coach Chinander, I think that group's in a really good place and will be for a while.
Well my office overlooks the weight room, so I don't get to see a lot but I can look down and watch them working out.
Last year, we had guys that couldn't even get through workouts that had no idea how hard we wanted them to work, and weren't motivated to do it.
Looking down this year, we're not starting from square one this year.
We're starting in a good spot.
I love what I see.
I love the good weight that people have put on.
I love the look of the bodies and I love even more the attitude that I'm seeing down there.
So that's where you can really transform your team and make it bigger, faster, stronger, and more importantly make it tougher and more close-knit.
I see really good things happening in there.
We're going to have an open competition at center.
Obviously Will Farniok is coming back.
Hunter Miller has a chance.
I think there's some guys playing guard right now that we're going to have to have snap the ball some to give us options with those guys.
Obviously Cam Jurgens moving there is going to be a piece of that, too.
So there's going to be open competitions at every spot and there's going to be some interesting ones in the spring, and center is definitely one of them.
When we had Marcus Mariota at Oregon, it was kind of tough to get the right guy for a couple years.
I think everybody could see what he was, and I don't know if you were necessarily going to sign the best kid in the country the next year after he had started as a redshirt freshman.
With that being said, here, Luke was one of our top guys on our board from the beginning.
He's a type of kid who's not afraid of competition.
I can't believe how quickly he's come in here and learned stuff, how hard he's been working and how excited he is.
So I think we got a really good one in this class.
We've got one coming in already for next class that I can't talk about.
You're not going to find an Adrian every day, but I love the kids that we're adding, including at that position.
To be honest with you I think that getting to know kids and getting an honest evaluation of their character on top of their talent leads you to getting the right type of kid.
I think the way we recruit lends itself to us getting those type of kids.
I think those type of kids are attracted to my coaching staff and the guys in our building because when they get to know us they see the character of these assistant coaches and other people and those are the kind of people they want to be around.
I think they see the honesty in the way we recruit them, the genuine nature in the way that we approach it and that appeals to the right type of kid.
I don't know if I have seen an incoming class in my career that has me as excited From that standpoint, you can go across the board as see kids that were winners in high school, were team captains in high school, were in state championships that were in playoff games and semifinal games and state championships.
I don't think we are going to be short on leadership from this class.
Yeah almost every single one.
I could just address the guys that are already on campus.
I don't know if I have seen a kid work harder in an offseason to learn an offseason than Luke (McCaffrey) and he has been kind of a little bit of the ring-leader of that group already.
Wandale (Robinson) is kind of the same way, coming in and learning and he is going to be able to play more than one position in his first year because of the way he learns and the way he approaches things.
Nick Henrich is cerebral and smart and a problem-solver and tough and I know he is going to be a leader on defense.
Garret Nelson is a wild man, I love it.
His energy is going to lead us in some good directions.
Chris Hickman, same way.
Brant Banks, same way.
Jamie Nance is doing a good job.
So, all these kids that are here I think have leadership potential.
The great thing is they're not the only ones and we have some more coming.
Touching on a few of them, Tate Wildeman is looking great, he was dealing with a knee last fall.
Cam Jones, had a shoulder and he is doing great in the weight room right now.
Casey Rogers had a shoulder , he is doing a great job and putting on weight.
CJ Smith is the one that got hurt in the middle of the season and that might take a little longer.
For the most part, all the other guys that we didn't have last season are up and going.
Man, those guys are going to make a difference in the team if they can approach this in the right way.
We will find out at spring ball how much work they were doing.
I called them the a__black sweatshirt posse' because they all sat on the same place on the wall during practice, wearing the same hooded sweatshirt.
Usually, the same one I had on so I went over and joined them from time to time.
Those guys are driven.
I mentioned Tate (Wildeman) and Casey (Rogers), Cam Jurgens, Cam Jones, Braxton (Clark) was over there a little bit.
There are some really talented kids and I would get a little upset looking over at how much talent we had sitting on the wall.
It was kind of just an unfortunate set of circumstances for those kids.
That is going to be almost like getting four or five or six more recruits in this class and guys that already have experience with our team.
So, I am anxious to put all those pieces together.
Yes.
First years are hard.
It is different for someone who Adrian (Martinez) or someone like that who comes in and plays, that is rare.
For the guys that have to redshirt, you are used to being a high school superstar and a junior high superstar and Pop Warner superstar and you come to a place and you don't even get to play the game, you're just practicing.
It can be hard on some kids.
Some kids use it the right way and take advantage of that year and really get bigger, stronger, faster, and learn scheme and they come back even better.
Some other kids struggle a little more.
The great thing is that I think we are going to get all our guys through that and they're all in a really good place right now.
I have to be honest with you, I haven't seen Mo (Maurice Washington) since I have been off the road.
I am sick of traveling and I am anxious to see him.
 I know (Head Strength and Conditioning Coach) Zach (Duval) is working hard with him and (Director of Performance Nutrition) Dave Eilis is working with him.
And he is not alone, there are a lot of guys that we need to get bigger and stronger and to mature.
I know how special Maurice could be if he was 200 to 210 pounds and he certainly didn't come in at that weight.
We are working hard with him, I think his biggest issue is making sure he is eating right and the nutrition side of it because he is working his butt of in the weight room.
Yeah, we want to grow the roster again.
That was one of the secret sauces around here for a long time.
Kenny Wilhite has done a great job with that.
Trent Mossbrucker in our recruiting department, Gerrod Lambrecht has done a great job with that.
I expect great things out of these walk-ons.
Kids that we're bringing in, we've brought a bunch in, in these last two classes.
I think it'll be very soon when some of those guys start helping us and down the road a little further, I think a lot of those guys are going to contribute playing and hopefully start for us.
But, I'm not going to just let guys be on the team just to be on the team either.
So, it's going to be competitive just like your opportunity to be a starter at the university is competitive.
That will put us in a really good place of where we have the right type of kids.
Kids that are on the team for the right reasons and hungry to be here.
We kind of have a clearance to be in the 150s, and probably low 150s.
I imagine there might be a little attrition.
There might be some guys that don't end up making it and some other things.
Some guys that graduate and move on.
We'll deal with that as the situations arises.
I imagine we'll end up in the 150s somewhere.
I want good people, and I want athletic potential.
Some of the guys we have are big and have huge frames and are good athletes.
Spencer Long is just a great example of what we're looking for.
He's a guy that was a tight end.
I don't think he ran quite long enough to be an NFL tight end, but he had a huge frame and a really good athlete.
A guy in this program got in strength conditioning and ends up being a great player in the NFL.
Not every guy has to be an over O or D-Lineman, but I certainly think there's a lot of those running around the Midwest and Nebraska, certainly looking for other positions, too.
If guys are going to play here, it's going to get harder and harder to play here and they better have some really good athleticism about them and better have a high upside.
If they do, we'll get them in the weight room, with the right attitude and they'll hit the field.
Moving forward, I hope we can afford to take that many numbers and we'll see where we can get our total roster to.
We're going to start to get a little more selective.
With that being said, if there is a great player in the state of Nebraska or surrounding states, and they want to be at Nebraska, and we'll find a way.
We're starting to get a lot of things about the roster where we wanted, including roster size and some guys we can really look forward to developing because we think they're going to help us from the walk-on program.
I'm not used to having Christmas off.
It was nice to be with family.
I don't ever want it to ever happen again.
I've said this before, I've never been so anxious to get started the next year like I was at the end of this past season.
Our entire team had that attitude.
It was great to see the Big Ten have good success from bowls.
There was some really good performances by Big Ten teams that we've battled with and played well with.
In some cases, had the chance to win or won the games.
It lets me know that even though the program wasn't anywhere near where I wanted it at the end of last season, maybe we're not that far away.
I think that can be a beacon of hope for all of us as we're working really hard this offseason.
I know Zac (Taylor) pretty well.
I would actually talk to Zac when he was playing here.
It's kind of a Nebraska quarterback brotherhood that exists with most of us.
Zac married the daughter of my head coach when I was in Green Bay.
Coach Sherman's daughter would be at practice in Green Bay.
All I know about Zac is that he is a football guy.
Everything I've ever heard about him is how much he loves the game, so he would be a reason to try and root for him and Cincinnati a little bit, and we wish him nothing but the best.
The biggest difference I see is how kids walk onto our floor more often.
They are around the coaches, they have smiles on their faces.
I think everybody is excited, and that's a far cry from where we were.
I walked into the first team meeting room, and you could've heard a pin drop in there.
That's not the team I want to coach.
I want a team to where I walk into the team meeting room and they a__re having fun and chatting it up and love being around each other and then they can dial it in and get to work.
The attitudes that I see and the comradery that I see isn't even on the same level, not even close to where it was a year ago.
I give credit to all of the assistant coaches that are working with them every day.
I think these guys are ready to have a lot of fun.
I saw him this morning.
He was going to class, I think.
He had a high ankle sprain, don't need to say much more about it.
He was so close to playing in the Iowa game, but just couldn't change direction well enough to trust him out there.
